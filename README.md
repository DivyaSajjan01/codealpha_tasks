# 🖊️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset.

---

## 📌 About the Project

- The model is trained on **images of digits (28x28 grayscale)**.
- It can identify which digit (0 to 9) is written.
- We used **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Google Colab** to build and train the model.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 🧠 Model Summary

The CNN model has:
- 2 Convolutional layers
- 2 MaxPooling layers
- 1 Flatten layer
- 2 Dense layers (last one with 10 outputs for digits)

---

## 🎯 Accuracy

- Test accuracy is around **98%**
